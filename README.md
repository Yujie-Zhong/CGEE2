# CGEE2
Code to implement conditional second-order estimating function for ascertained family data.
Details are available from Zhong and Cook (2017). Second-order estimating equations for the analysis of current status data from response-dependent biased family studies. Statistics in Biosciences.
'sim.CGEE2.structured.family.r' contains all required functions to implement conditionaly second-order estimating function to the structured 2-generation family data subject to ascertainment bias.
'script.CGEE2.structured.family.r' gives an example to generate the ascertained family data and then implement the proposed methods (CGEE2) to it.
