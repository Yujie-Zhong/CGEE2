     Sample code for the generation and analysis of data by the implementation of conditional generalized estimating equations (CGEE2)

This site provides the code to implement the conditional second-order estimating function approach for the analysis of clustered family data obtained via a biased sampling scheme. Details are available from  Zhong and Cook (2017).

The program 'sim.CGEE2.structured.family.r' contains all of the required functions to solve the conditional second-order estimating  function for structured 2-generation family data subject to ascertainment bias. 

The function to generate the structured 2-generation family data subject to ascertainment bias is also provided in 'sim.CGEE2.structured.family.r'. 

The program 'script.CGEE2.structured.family.r' gives an example on how to generate the family data subject to the selection bias and then to implement the proposed methods (CGEE2).
